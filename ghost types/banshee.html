                The Banshee will lock on to one player and use this players sanity to determine if it is able to hunt. 
                This hunt target will be the only one chased or even killed by the ghost assuming they
                are in the building. All other players will be completely ignored by the Banshee during a hunt. This also means that during a D.O.T.S. interaction
                the ghost will move towards the hunt target rather than the nearest player. In addition, the player will lose 15% sanity instead of
                the usual 10% if the hunt target walks into a Banshee during a singing event to cause the event to cancel. It also fears the 
                crucifix and will be less aggressive near it compared to other ghosts.

    <h3>
        Testing for Banshee
    </h3>

    <div class = "wrapper">
        <div style="display:inline-block; text-decoration:none; color:#7aa1bd; margin-left: 5%; text-align: left; margin-bottom: -3%;">
            <p> 
                In order to test for a Banshee you can use a parabolic mic. Listen through the parabolic mic for ghost noises, and if you hear a scream
                (it will be very distinct and an example is given in the "More..." tab in the home screen.), that is a Banshee. Keep in mind, however, it 
                only has a 33% chance of making the shriek noise, so if you hear a different interaction in the mic do not rule out a Banshee. Another
                way to determine a Banshee is if, during a hunt, the Banshee passes through or completely ignores a player right in front of them rather than
                killing them.
